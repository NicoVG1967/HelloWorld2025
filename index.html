    <h2> About Sharkette/Ecstasy</h2>
    <paragraph>She attends all the punk shows in her area. 
      She makes sure to have a healthy meal before every show 
      so she has lots of energy to dance. You should see her 
      ticket collectionâ€”it fills an entire bulletin board! 
      Want to join Essy at her next show?
